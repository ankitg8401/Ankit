    <h1>PROGRAMMING</h1>
    Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.<br>
    <h1>VIDEO TRANSCRIPT</h1>
    Hi, welcome to programming if you've never learned to program before it you might be wondering what programming actually is well when we write a program we're giving the computer a series of commands that kind of look like a weird form of English you can think of a computer as a very obedient dog listening to your every command and doing whatever you tell it to do so what's so cool about programming well it really depends on what you think is cool because as it turns out you can use programming for almost everything programs control robots that can take care of patients and my favorite robots that can roam around Mars and look for water on the surface programs help self-driving cars know which way to turn which is pretty important programs help doctors cure diseases by processing huge amounts of medical data programs can be really fun games like doodle jump Angry Birds minecraft programs make it possible for Pixar to put out their awesome 3d animated movies and for movies like Harry Potter to have such cool special effects what's your favorite movie I bet that a computer helped make it somehow programs are behind the websites and the apps that you use every day all the time like Google Maps and Wikipedia and YouTube and of course where you are now Khan Academy here on Khan Academy you'll learn how to write JavaScript programs to make drawings animations and games and that will be a great start towards creating whatever you're imagining in your head I know it might be hard to see how a drawing program relates to programs for robots or curing diseases but believe it or not the same basic concepts are used by pretty much every programmer in every program once you learn to program JavaScript you'll be able to learn other programming languages much more easily now you just gotta keep going.<br>
    <h1>COMPILER LANGUAGE</h1>
High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957[11] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.<br>

These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. The first compiler for a programming language was developed by Grace Hopper.[12] When Hopper went to work on UNIVAC in 1949, she brought the idea of using compilers with her.[13][14] Compilers harness the power of computers to make programming easier[11] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation (e.g., Y = X*2 + 5*X + 9) for example. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation which permitted the abstraction of reusable blocks of code, came out in 1957[11] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research. In 1951 Frances E. Holberton developed the first sort-merge generator, which ran on the UNIVAC I.[15] Another woman working at UNIVAC, Adele Mildred Koss, developed a program that was a precursor to report generators.[15] The idea for the creation of COBOL started in 1959 when Mary K. Hawes, who worked for the Burroughs Corporation, set up a meeting to discuss creating a common business language.[16] She invited six people, including Grace Hopper.[16] Hopper was involved in developing COBOL as a business language and creating "self-documenting" programming.[17][18] Hopper's contribution to COBOL was based on her programming language, called FLOW-MATIC.[14] In 1961, Jean E. Sammet developed FORMAC and also published Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, which went on to be a standard work on programming languages.[16][19]<br>
<h1>SOURCE CODE ENTRY</h1>
Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. See Computer programming in the punch card era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Frances Holberton created a code to allow keyboard inputs while she worked at UNIVAC.[20]<BR>

Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller worked on developing the programming language BASIC while she was a graduate student at Dartmouth in the 1960s.[21] One of the first object-oriented programming languages, Smalltalk, was developed by seven programmers, including Adele Goldberg, in the 1970s.[22]<BR>
   <H1> ALGORITHMS COMPLEXITY</H1>
The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.<BR>
   <H1> METHODOLOGIES</H1>
The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.<BR>


Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.<BR>

A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).<BR>

Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic languages.<BR>
    <H1>DEBUGGING</H1>
    Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.<BR>

After the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, when a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file, a simplification of the test case that results in only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Trial-and-error/divide-and-conquer is needed: the programmer will try to remove some parts of the original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear. Scripting and breakpointing is also part of this process.<BR>

Debugging is often done with IDEs. Standalone debuggers like GDB are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a command line. Some text editors such as Emacs allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment.<BR>
